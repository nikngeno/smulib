* **Ease of Use:** Ensuring the website is intuitive for users regardless of technical background.
* **Resource Management:** Streamlining library operations such as book management and user reservations.
* **Educational Experience:** Leveraging the project to deepen our practical knowledge in web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.

## Features

### User Features

* **Secure Authentication:** Safe and personalized access.
* **Book Management:** Search, borrow, purchase, and reserve books.
* **Room and Librarian Reservations:** Online booking system for study rooms and librarian sessions.
* **Personalized User Pages:** History tracking and account management.

### Librarian and Admin Features

* **Administrative Controls:** Secure login with role-specific permissions.
* **Catalog Management:** Adding, updating, and removing books.
* **User and Staff Management:** Account creation and role management capabilities.

### General Website Features

* **Responsive Design:** Seamlessly accessible across devices.
* **Interactive Calendar:** Event listings and reservation functionalities.
* **Shopping Cart:** Dynamic cart updates, purchase notifications, and checkout.
* **Secure Login:** Password protection through PHP hashing.
* **Google Maps Integration:** Visual directions to library locations.

## Technical Specifications

### System Requirements

* **Software:** Web browsers (client-side), XAMPP stack (Apache, MySQL, PHP), Visual Studio Code, GitHub
* **Hardware:** Windows OS, minimum 4GB RAM, 10GB HDD

### Technologies Used

* **Front-end:** HTML, CSS (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
* **Back-end:** PHP (prepared statements, password hashing)
* **Database:** MySQL (normalized database structure, efficient relational querying)
* **Version Control:** GitHub (collaboration, branching, reviews)

### Database Structure

Core tables include:

* **Books:** Title, author, ISBN, genre
* **Users:** Profiles and account statuses
* **Borrowing Transactions:** Borrow details and due dates
* **Reservations:** Book and room reservations
* **Events:** Library events management
* **Staff:** Librarian and administrative information

## Project Evaluation

### Strengths
