<p style="font-size: 14px; color: red; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">My name is Nicholas, though I go by Nick. I'm an international student from Kenya and currently a junior at Saint Martin University, where I'm working toward a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science. Before Saint Martin, I studied at Pierce College, and I'm now in my third year in the United States journey thats broadened my perspective both academically and culturally.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: blue; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">My time at Saint Martin has been both challenging and rewarding. Every day, I dive deeper into the world of computer science, exploring everything from data analytics to innovative programming techniques. The experience has not only strengthened my technical skills but also nurtured a passion for discovering how data can be used to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; color: green; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Before shifting my focus to data science, I built a career in Quality and Operational Excellence leadership. This background gave me invaluable insights into process improvement, effective team management, and strategic problem-solving. Combining this experience with my studies has been a natural progression, allowing me to see the powerful ways in which data-driven solutions can enhance business operations.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: purple; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">Looking to the future, I aspire to merge my leadership experience with my technical expertise to develop innovative solutions that address complex challenges. Whether collaborating on projects or exploring independent research, I am excited to continue my journey of learning, growth, and making a positive impact in the dynamic world of technology and data science.</p>
