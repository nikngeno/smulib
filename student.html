		<p><b>VISION, MISSION, OR PURPOSE</b> </p>
		<ul>
		<p>Mathematics contributes in a unique way to the development of the disciplined, rational person.
		It improves ones ability to fit new concepts into a framework of existing knowledge.</p>
		<p>The mathematics program at Saint Martins University provides a basic undergraduate program for mathematics majors, supports other majors in the University and offers courses of general interest. Students graduating with a bachelors degree in mathematics frequently find employment in secondary schools, insurance firms, and the financial or computing divisions of large companies. </p>
		</ul>
		<p><b> LEARNING OUTCOMES:</b> </p>
		<ul type = "square">
		<li type ="circle"><p><b>Saint Martins math majors will:</b></p></li>
		<ul type= "disc">
		<li> Possess a strong foundation in traditional mathematical areas. Students will demonstrate an understanding of foundational mathematics in a three-semester Calculus sequence coupled with the ability to apply Calculus principles in Differential Equations, Mathematical Modeling, and/or Probability and Statistics.</li> 
		<li> Understand and write rigorous proofs for theorems, corollaries, and lemmas. Students will be skilled in a variety of proof methods and have strong axiomatic reasoning skills. Students will be able to apply these skills in the context of Geometry, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, and/or Complex Variables.</li> 
		</ul>
		<li type ="circle"><p><b>Saint Martins science and engineering majors will:</b> </p></li>
		<ul>
		<li>Possess the mathematical and statistical backgrounds required for their fields of study. Like the math majors, engineering and science students will demonstrate an understanding of foundational mathematics in a two or threesemester Calculus sequence coupled with the ability to apply Calculus principles in Differential Equations or apply PreCalculus to algebra-based Physics. </li>
		</ul>
		<li type ="circle"><p><b>Saint Martins business and accounting majors will:</b></p></li>
		<ul>
		<li> Possess the mathematical and statistical backgrounds required for their fields of study. Business and accounting students will demonstrate an understanding of probabilistic and statistical principles as well as be able to apply these principles in Operations Research, Applied Quantitative Reasoning, and Finance. </li>
		</ul>
		<li type ="circle"><p><b>Saint Martins liberal arts majors will:</b></p></li>
		<ul>
		<li> Develop an appreciation of the role of mathematics in modern society. Liberal arts majors will demonstrate the ability to apply mathematics to a variety of real-world situations such as selecting the best home mortgage or making investment decisions. </li>
		</ul>
		</ul>
		<p><b>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b> </p>
		<ul>
		<p>The Mathematics Department requires students who have no record of successful completion (grade of C- or better) of a necessary prerequisite to take the Mathematics Placement Exams. The Mathematics Placement Exams will identify the course number(s) of the introductory math course(s) for which the student is best prepared. </p>
		<p>A recommendation of a course by the Mathematics Placement Exams will be considered an <strong> equivalent math placement exam score</strong> in determining prerequisites. Note, however, that a student cannot earn academic credit through the results of the Mathematics Placement Exams. For more information regarding the rules for taking and retaking the Math Placement Exams, please contact the chair of the Mathematics Department. </p>
